## 📚 About the Chair

**Cátedra MANEDS (MásOrange – University of Alcalá)** promotes **applied research** and **training** projects around **network engineering** and **digital services**, connecting real industry challenges with academic work (Bachelor's/Master's theses, scholarships, prototypes and publications).

Our work is primarily organized into these lines:

| | |
|---|---|
| 🔬 **Research projects and lines** | Proposal and development of projects linked to real challenges (e.g., AI applied to operations and customer service, access networks, biometrics, urban mobility and digital channels). |
| 🎓 **Training and tutoring (Bachelor's/Master's theses / scholarships)** | Student incorporation into projects with accompaniment and practical learning. |
| 🤝 **University-industry collaboration** | Coordinated work between UAH and the company's professional team, with applied approach and results orientation. |
| 📣 **Dissemination and transfer** | Publication of advances, results and materials (website, documentation and repositories when applicable). |
