*Advancing the future of network engineering and digital services through education, research, and innovation*

</div>

## 👋 Welcome

Welcome to the **Cátedra MANEDS** organization! We are dedicated to advancing knowledge and skills in network engineering and digital services through collaborative projects, research, and educational initiatives.

## 📚 About Us

Cátedra MANEDS is a partnership focused on:

- 🔬 **Research & Innovation**: Exploring cutting-edge technologies in networking and digital services
- 🎯 **Education**: Providing hands-on learning opportunities for students and professionals
- 🤝 **Collaboration**: Fostering partnerships between academia and industry
- 💡 **Open Source**: Contributing to and maintaining open-source projects

## 📋 General Considerations

### 🏷️ Repository Naming Convention

We follow a structured naming convention to maintain organization and clarity across all projects:

#### **Repository & Group Names**

All repository and group names use **kebab-case** format:
- ✅ `example-repository-name`
- ✅ `network-tools`
- ❌ `ExampleRepositoryName`
- ❌ `example_repository_name`

#### **Full Repository Names**

A full repository name indicates both the group and the repository, separated by an underscore: **`group-name_repo-name`**

**Example:**

The following repository names:
- `first-group_first-repo`
- `first-group_second-repo`
- `second-group_first-repo`

Are equivalent to this organizational structure:

```
📁 Organization
├── 📂 first-group/
│   ├── 📄 first-repo
│   └── 📄 second-repo
└── 📂 second-group/
    └── 📄 first-repo
```

This naming convention helps to:
- 🔍 Quickly identify which group a repository belongs to
- 📊 Organize repositories logically by project or topic
- 🔗 Maintain clear relationships between related repositories
