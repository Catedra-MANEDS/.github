### General Considerations

1. **Repository Naming Convention**:

  - Repository & group names:
  
    All repository and group names will be **kebab-case** (e.g. example-repository-name).
    
  - Full repository names:
  
    A full repository name indicates the repository name along with the group it belongs to.
    It will include both the group and repository name as follows -> **group-name_repo-name**
    For instance, the following repositories:
    
    - first-group_first-repo
    - first-group_second-repo
    - second-group_first-repo
    
    Would be equivalent to the below tree structure:
    
    ```
    .
    ├── first-group/
    │   ├── first-repo
    │   └── second-repo
    └── second-group/
        └── first-repo
    ```
